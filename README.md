#Simple Curve Follower

This is example code for APSC1299 at Kwantlen Polytechnic University.

##Target

This project is for a PIC18F4525 on a modified Sumovore robot. (we upgrade the MCU and modify the wiring to allow dynamic braking). 

##Tools

The project file was created in MPlab IDE version 8.5.
The project has now been modified to use the XC8 compiler.

##Purpose

As is this code allows the robot to follow simple curved lines. It is a starting point for students who will modify the code so that the robot will be able to follow much more complex lines with abrupt sharp turns, gaps in the line, crossing lines and other obstacles.
